## LaunchWrapperPrototype
Simpel prototype to test excuting a jar with arguments. Then capturing its output to a console and log file. The end goal of this prototype is to build logic for a testing application. In which jars will be run, tested for output, and then shutdown. Data will then be logged in passed back to a test validator.
